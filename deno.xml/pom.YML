The revenue experience for the issuing entity in the following table is calculated on a cash basis. Finance charges, fees and interchange are comprised of monthly periodic finance charges, annual membership fees and other credit card fees and interchange amounts. + +Revenue Experience + +Chase Issuance Trust + +(dollars in thousands) + + + + Six Months +Ended Year Ended December 31, + June 30, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 +Finance Charges, Fees and Interchange + + $ 1,112,115 $ 2,259,157 $ 2,365,611 $ 5,078,088 $ 5,958,692 +Yield from Finance Charges, Fees and Interchange(1) + + 21.62 %(2) 21.18 % 19.11 % 19.87 % 19.27 % + + +(1) +Yield from Finance Charges, Fees and Interchange is the result of dividing finance charges, fees and interchange amounts, by the Average Pool Balance for the periods indicated. + +(2) +Annualized. + +The revenue experience will be affected by numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the monthly periodic finance charges on the credit card receivables, other fees and interchange amounts, changes in the delinquency and loss rates on the credit card receivables, the percentage of revolving credit card accounts bearing finance charges at promotional rates and the percentage of cardholders who pay their balances in full each month and do not incur monthly periodic finance charges. These factors may in turn be caused or affected by a variety of other factors, including seasonal spend variations, the availability of other sources of credit and general economic conditions, unemployment levels, consumer spending and borrowing patterns, all of which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, revenue experience will be affected by future changes in the types of charges and fees assessed by JPMorgan Chase Bank on the revolving credit card accounts and on the types of additional revolving credit card accounts added to the issuing entity from time to time. + +The revenue experience from periodic finance charges and fees—other than annual fees—depends in part upon the collective preference of cardholders to use their credit cards as revolving debt instruments for purchases and cash advances and to pay account balances over several months—as opposed to convenience use, where cardholders pay off their entire balance each month, thereby avoiding periodic finance charges on their purchases—and upon other credit card related services for which the cardholder pays a fee. + +Principal Payment Rates + +The cardholder monthly principal payment rate for each month is calculated as a percentage of the Pool Balance as of the first day of that month, subject to adjustment for additions and removals of assets that occur in that month. + +Cardholder Monthly Principal Payment Rates + +Chase Issuance Trust + + + +Receivables Principal Payment Rate Six Months +Ended Year Ended December 31, + June 30, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 +Lowest Month + + 44.96 % 38.09 % 31.79 % 32.09 % 31.32 % +Highest Month + + 51.02 % 51.09 % 42.29 % 38.27 % 34.80 % +Monthly Average + + 48.38 % 45.50 % 36.30 % 34.98 % 33.37 % + + +4 + +Composition of Issuing Entity Receivables. + +As of June 30, 2022 (which reflects the reassignment of approximately (20,166,731 ) (0.22 )% +No Balance + + 2,743,214 48.89 0 0.00 +$0.00 to 9,328,416,845 100.00 % + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +1 +See the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 26, 2022. + + + +5 + +Composition by Credit Limit + +Chase Issuance Trust + + + + Number +of +Accounts Percentage +of +Total +Number of +Accounts Amount of +Receivables Percentage +of +Total +Amount +of +Receivables +$0.01 to $5,000.00 + + 921,515 16.42 % $ 399,669,434 4.28 % +$5,000.01 to 9,328,416,845 100.00 % + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +Composition by Period of Delinquency + +Chase Issuance Trust + + + +Payment Status (Days Contractually + +Delinquent) + + Number +of +Accounts Percentage +of +Total +Number +of +Accounts Amount of +Receivables Percentage +of +Total +Amount +of +Receivables +Not Delinquent + + 5,581,000 99.46 % $ 9,187,766,147 98.49 % +Up to 29 Days + + 19,515 0.35 79,257,340 0.85 +30 to 59 Days + + 3,700 0.07 18,065,288 0.20 +60 to 89 Days + + 2,146 0.04 13,517,070 0.14 +90 to 119 Days + + 1,752 0.03 11,292,527 0.12 +120 to 149 Days + + 1,434 0.03 10,198,535 0.11 +150 to 179 Days + + 1,204 0.02 8,319,938 0.09 +180 or More Days + + 0 0.00 0 0.00 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +Total + + 5,610,751 100.00 % $ 9,328,416,845 100.00 % + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +Composition by Account Age + +Chase Issuance Trust + + + +Age Range Number +of +Accounts Percentage +of +Total +Number +of +Accounts Amount of +Receivables Percentage +of +Total +Amount +of +Receivables +Less than or equal to 6 Months + + 0 0.00 % $ 0 0.00 % +Over 6 Months to 12 Months + + 0 0.00 0 0.00 +Over 12 Months to 24 Months + + 0 0.00 0 0.00 +Over 24 Months to 36 Months + + 0 0.00 0 0.00 +Over 36 Months to 48 Months + + 0 0.00 0 0.00 +Over 48 Months to 60 Months + + 0 0.00 0 0.00 +Over 60 Months to 120 Months + + 0 0.00 0 0.00 +Over 120 Months + + 5,610,751 100.00 9,328,416,845 100.00 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +Total + + 5,610,751 100.00 % $ 9,328,416,845 100.00 % + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +6 + +FICO® Scores + +The following table reflects the distribution of the FICO scores for a statistically significant random sample of credit card accounts included in the Trust Portfolio received by JPMorgan Chase Bank in June 2022 and the outstanding receivables balances of the related accounts as of June 30, 2022.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

branch-suffix	The branch suffix type when using the alternative branching strategy. Valid values are random, timestamp and short-commit-hash. See Alternative strategy for details.	
base	Sets the pull request base branch.	Defaults to the branch checked out in the workflow.
push-to-fork	A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. owner/repo-fork. The pull request will be created to merge the fork's branch into the parent's base. See push pull request branches to a fork for details.

assignees	A comma or newline-separated list of assignees (GitHub usernames).	
reviewers	A comma or newline-separated list of reviewers (GitHub usernames) to request a review from.	
team-reviewers	A comma or newline-separated list of GitHub teams to request a review from. Note that a repo scoped PAT may be required. See this issue.	
milestone	The number of the milestone to associate this pull request with.	
draft	Create a draft pull request.	false
Action outputs
The pull request number and URL are available as step outputs. Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.

      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
      - name: Check outputs
        run: |
          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
Action behaviour
The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed. Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the branch input. Any subsequent changes will be committed to the same branch and reflected in the open pull request.

How the action behaves:

If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new branch and a pull request created.
If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if delete-branch is set to true the branch will be deleted.
For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage.

Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed. This strategy is not recommended because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the default strategy of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.

To use this strategy, set input branch-suffix with one of the following options.

random - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr, create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd

timestamp - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-1569322532, create-pull-request/patch-1569322552

short-commit-hash - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59, create-pull-request/patch-394710b

Controlling commits
As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs. Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for events which checkout a commit.

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Create commits
        run: |
          git config user.name 'Peter Evans'
          git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'
          date +%s > report.txt
          git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"
          date +%s > new-report.txt
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"
      - name: Uncommitted change
        run: date +%s > report.txt
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
Ignoring files
If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a .gitignore file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.

Create a project card
To create a project card for the pull request, pass the pull-request-number step output to create-or-update-project-card action.

      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3

      - name: Create or Update Project Card
        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1
        with:
          project-name: My project
          column-name: My column
          issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}
Reference Example
The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes. Check the defaults to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.

See examples for more realistic use cases.

jobs:
  createPullRequest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Make changes to pull request
        run: date +%s > report.txt

      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
