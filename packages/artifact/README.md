# `@actions/artifact`

## Usage

You can use this package to interact with the Actions artifacts.

This most recently published version of this package (`1.1.1`) can be found [here](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/@actions/artifact@1.1.1/packages/artifact)

## ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§

This package is currently undergoing a major overhaul in preparation for `v4` versions of `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` (these Actions will use a new `2.0.0` version of `@actions/artifact` that will soon be released). The upcoming version of `@actions/artifact` will take advantage of a major re-architecture with entirely new APIs.

The upcoming `2.0.0` package and `v4` artifact Actions aim to solve some of the major pain-points that have made artifact usage difficult up until now.
