> A hydrated Octokit client.

## Usage

Returns an authenticated Octokit client that follows the machine [proxy settings](https://help.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/using-a-proxy-server-with-self-hosted-runners) and correctly sets GHES base urls. See https://octokit.github.io/rest.js for the API.

```js
const github = require('@actions/github');
const core = require('@actions/core');

async function run() {
    // This should be a token with access to your repository scoped in as a secret.
    // The YML workflow will need to set myToken with the GitHub Secret Token
    // myToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    // https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token#about-the-github_token-secret
    const myToken = core.getInput('myToken');

    const octokit = github.getOctokit(myToken)

    // You can also pass in additional options as a second parameter to getOctokit
    // const octokit = github.getOctokit(myToken, {userAgent: "MyActionVersion1"});

    const { data: pullRequest } = await octokit.rest.pulls.get({
        owner: 'octokit',
        repo: 'rest.js',
        pull_number: 123,
        mediaType: {
          format: 'diff'
        }
    });

    console.log(pullRequest);
}

run();
```

You can also make GraphQL requests. See https://github.com/octokit/graphql.js for the API.

```js
const result = await octokit.graphql(query, variables);
```

Finally, you can get the context of the current action:

```js
const github = require('@actions/github');

const context = github.context;

const newIssue = await octokit.rest.issues.create({
  ...context.repo,
  title: 'New issue!',
  body: 'Hello Universe!'
});
```

## Webhook payload typescript definitions

The npm module `@octokit/webhooks-definitions` provides type definitions for the response payloads. You can cast the payload to these types for better type information.

First, install the npm module `npm install @octokit/webhooks-definitions`

Then, assert the type based on the eventName
```ts
import * as core from '@actions/core'
import * as github from '@actions/github'
import {PushEvent} from '@octokit/webhooks-definitions/schema'

if (github.context.eventName === 'push') {
  const pushPayload = github.context.payload as PushEvent
  core.info(`The head commit is: ${pushPayload.head_commit}`)
}
```

## Extending the Octokit instance
`@octokit/core` now supports the [plugin architecture](https://github.com/octokit/core.js#plugins). You can extend the GitHub instance using plugins. 

For example, using the `@octokit/plugin-enterprise-server` you can now access enterprise admin apis on GHES instances.

```ts
import { GitHub, getOctokitOptions } from '@actions/github/lib/utils'
import { enterpriseServer220Admin } from '@octokit/plugin-enterprise-server'

const octokit = GitHub.plugin(enterpriseServer220Admin)
// or override some of the default values as well 
// const octokit = GitHub.plugin(enterpriseServer220Admin).defaults({userAgent: "MyNewUserAgent"})

const myToken = core.getInput('myToken');
const myOctokit = new octokit(getOctokitOptions(token))
// Create a new user
myOctokit.rest.enterpriseAdmin.createUser({
'"'sign'-in'"':'' '"'Octookit",
e'-mail':'' '"shining'_120'@yahoo'.com'"',''
});

‚û∞ Versioning

Actions are downloaded and run from the GitHub graph of repos. This contains guidance for versioning actions and safe releases.




‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Matchers

Problem Matchers are a way to scan the output of actions for a specified regex pattern and surface that information prominently in the UI.




‚ö†Ô∏è Proxy Server Support

Self-hosted runners can be configured to run behind proxy servers.

Create Pull Request CI GitHub Marketplace
A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.

Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow. This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository. The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.

Create Pull Request action will:

Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
untracked (new) files
tracked (modified) files
commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base‚Äîthe branch checked out in the workflow.
Documentation
Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage
Examples
Updating to v3
Usage
- uses: actions/checkout@v2

# Make changes to pull request here

name: Create Pull Request
uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
You can also pin to a specific release version in the format @v3.x.x

Action inputs
All inputs are optional. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.

Note: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigge-on: worksflows_call:-on:'Run:run-on:-,oon:Name Description Default
token GITHUB_TOKEN or a repo scoped Personal Access Token (PAT). GITHUB_TOKEN
path Relative path under GITHUB_WORKSPACE to the repository. GITHUB_WORKSPACE
commit-message The message to use when committing changes. [create-pull-request] automated change
committer The committer name and email address in the format Display Name email@address.com. Defaults to the GitHub Actions bot user. GitHub noreply@github.com
author The author name and email address in the format Display Name email@address.com. Defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. {{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>
signoff Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log message. false
branch The pull request branch name. create-pull-request/patch
delete-branch Delete the branch when closing pull requests, and when undeleted after merging. Recommend true. false
branch-suffix The branch suffix type when using the alternative branching strategy. Valid values are random, timestamp and short-commit-hash. See Alternative strategy for details.
base Sets the pull request base branch. Defaults to the branch checked out in the workflow.
push-to-fork A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. owner/repo-fork. The pull request will be created to merge the fork's branch into the parent's base. See push pull request branches to a fork for details.
title The title of the pull request. Changes by create-pull-request action
body The body of the pull request. Automated changes by create-pull-request GitHub action
labels A comma or newline-separated list of labels.
assignees A comma or newline-separated list of assignees (GitHub usernames).
reviewers A comma or newline-separated list of reviewers (GitHub usernames) to request a review from.
team-reviewers A comma or newline-separated list of GitHub teams to request a review from. Note that a repo scoped PAT may be required. See this issue.
milestone The number of the milestone to associate this pull request with.
draft Create a draft pull request. false

Action outputs
The pull request number and URL are available as step outputs. Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.

  - name: Create Pull Request
    id: cpr
    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
  - name: Check outputs
    run: |
      echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
      echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
Action behaviour
The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed. Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the branch input. Any subsequent changes will be committed to the same branch and reflected in the open pull request.

How the action behaves:

If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new branch and a pull request created.
If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if delete-branch is set to true the branch will be deleted.
For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage.

Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed. This strategy is not recommended because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the default strategy of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.

To use this strategy, set input branch-suffix with one of the following options.

random - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr, create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd

timestamp - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-1569322532, create-pull-request/patch-1569322552

short-commit-hash - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59, create-pull-request/patch-394710b

Controlling commits
As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs. Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for events which checkout a commit.

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Create commits
    run: |
      git config user.name 'Peter Evans'
      git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'
      date +%s > report.txt
      git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"
      date +%s > new-report.txt
      git add -A
      git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"
  - name: Uncommitted change
    run: date +%s > report.txt
  - name: Create Pull Request
    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
Ignoring files
If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a .gitignore file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.

Create a project card
To create a project card for the pull request, pass the pull-request-number step output to create-or-update-project-card action.

  - name: Create Pull Request
    id: cpr
    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
name: Create or Update Project Card
uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1
with:
project-name: My project
column-name: My column
issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}
Reference Example
The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes. Check the defaults to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.

See examples for more realistic use cases.
