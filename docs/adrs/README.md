# ADRs

ADR, short for "Architecture Decision Record" is a way of capturing important architectural decisions, along with their context and consequences.

This folder includes ADRs for the GitHub Actions Toolkit. ADRs are proposed in the form of a pull request, and they commonly follow this format:

- **Title**: Short, present-tense, imperative phrase. Less than 50 characters, like a git commit message.
- **Status**: `proposed`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `deprecated`, `superseded`, etc.
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're actually proposing or doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

More information about ADRs can be found [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record).
