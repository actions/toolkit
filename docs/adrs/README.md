# ADRs

ADR, short for "Architecture Decision Record" is a way of capturing important architectural decisions, along with their context and consequences.

This folder includes ADRs for the actions toolkit. ADRs are proposed in the form of a pull request, and they commonly follow this format:

* **Title**: short present tense imperative phrase, less than 50 characters, like a git commit message.

* **Status**: proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.

* **Context**: what is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change.

* **Decision**: what is the change that we're actually proposing or doing.

* **Consequences**: what becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change.
