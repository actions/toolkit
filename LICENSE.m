7.       Restart the computer and check if issue persists.

Important: This method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:.

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows

However, if issue persists, as you have mentioned that this issue occurs in client systems, I would suggest you to post this query in our TechNet Forums where you will find the appropriate support for security issues related to domain and enterprise environments.

Meanwhile, you may also make use of the Feedback Hub, where you can tell Microsoft about any problems you run in to while using Windows 10 and send suggestions to help us improve your Windows experience.

Regards,

Vivian S

Important: This method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:.

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows

However, if issue persists, as you have mentioned that this issue occurs in client systems, I would suggest you to post this query in our TechNet Forums where you will find the appropriate support for security issues related to domain and enterprise environments.

Meanwhile, you may also make use of the Feedback Hub, where you can tell Microsoft about any problems you run in to while using Windows 10 and send suggestions to help us improve your Windows experience.
