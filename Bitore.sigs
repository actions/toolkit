Create Pull Request action will:

Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
untracked (new) files
tracked (modified) files
commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base—the branch checked out in the workflow.

The pull request number and URL are available as step outputs. Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.

      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
      - name: Check outputs
        run: |
          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
Action behaviour
The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed. Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the branch input. Any subsequent changes will be committed to the same branch and reflected in the open pull request.

How the action behaves:

If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new branch and a pull request created.
If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if delete-branch is set to true the branch will be deleted.
For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage.

Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed. This strategy is not recommended because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the default strategy of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.

To use this strategy, set input branch-suffix with one of the following options.

random - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr, create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd

timestamp - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-1569322532, create-pull-request/patch-1569322552

short-commit-hash - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59, create-pull-request/patch-394710b

Controlling commits
As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs. Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for events which checkout a commit.

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Create commits
        run: |
          git config user.name 'Peter Evans'
          git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'
          date +%s > report.txt
          git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"
          date +%s > new-report.txt
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"
      - name: Uncommitted change
        run: date +%s > report.txt
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
Ignoring files
If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a .gitignore file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.

Create a project card
To create a project card for the pull request, pass the pull-request-number step output to create-or-update-project-card action.

A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.

Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow. This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository. The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.

Create Pull Request action will:

Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
untracked (new) files
tracked (modified) files
commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base—the branch checked out in the workflow.

Action outputs
The pull request number and URL are available as step outputs. Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.

      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
      - name: Check outputs
        run: |
          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
Action behaviour
The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed. Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the branch input. Any subsequent changes will be committed to the same branch and reflected in the open pull request.

How the action behaves:

If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new branch and a pull request created.
If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if delete-branch is set to true the branch will be deleted.
For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage.

Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed. This strategy is not recommended because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the default strategy of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.

To use this strategy, set input branch-suffix with one of the following options.

random - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr, create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd

timestamp - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-1569322532, create-pull-request/patch-1569322552

short-commit-hash - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59, create-pull-request/patch-394710b

Controlling commits
As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs. Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for events which checkout a commit.

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Create commits
        run: |
          git config user.name 'Peter Evans'
          git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'
          date +%s > report.txt
          git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"
          date +%s > new-report.txt
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"
      - name: Uncommitted change
        run: date +%s > report.txt
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
Ignoring files
If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a .gitignore file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.

Create a project card
To create a project card for the pull request, pass the pull-request-number step output to create-or-update-project-card action.
